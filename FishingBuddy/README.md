# **Application Name** 
Fishing app named Fishing Buddy.

# **Summary** 
The project idea I have created is a fishing app that would let users order bait for their fishing needs. The app would feature different fishing bait and show availability for ordering them. Fishing season charts and graphs would show how good the fishing is during specific seasons using different varieties of bait and which species to target with a specific bait. When fishing first caught my attention, I had to research and practice a lot of techniques to get results. As it is my passion, I have decided to create this app because it would guide beginners in their fishing journey and help them to decide which bait is better for catching a specific fish. I want to help beginners get results right away and not lose time looking for the right information. This app would serve as a guide based on my suggestions. Therefore, by providing this information, beginners will have a better chance of putting a fish into the net. The app would collect each userâ€™s personal information. It will also have a section that lets the user target species they love and also to add future suggestions for bait to buy and techniques to practice.

# **Design Specifications** 
This app has a friendly design with a color pallet that is pleasing to the eye of the user. The font is large enough for the user to read the information and the tones of the site are classic and warm. I have accomplished this design aesthetic by sticking to simple and contemporary fonts and colors for the website. I tried to create this app so the user would navigate through it smoothly without confusion and have a better user interface experience that is easy to follow.

# **Future Work**
The app requires more work before I can call it complete. I still need to add the graphs and charts. I would modify and update the content: the description of bait and its pictures. Additionally, I would consider including more links for the user to get more information on the bait as well as for what fish can be caught with what bait. It also needs techniques to use with each bait, payment options to be included and a profile edit tab.
