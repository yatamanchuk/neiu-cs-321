#H1**Application Name** 
Fishing app named FishBuddy.

#**Project Topic/Objective** 
A fishing app that would help users (beginner anglers) with general information about fishing. Users would be able to get information about fish species. Different techniques and styles of catching a specific fish would be presented to the users. The app would feature different fishing baits, how to use, and where to buy them. Fishing seasons charts and graphs that would show how good is fish during that season and what kind of species to target.

#**Motivation** 
When fishing caught my attention, I had to research and practice a lot of techniques to get results. As it is my passion, I have decided to do this app which would guide beginners with their fishing journey. I want to help beginners get results right away and not lose time looking for the right information throughout useless websites. This app would serve as the guide based on my suggestions and would contain my own suggested websites. Therefore, by providing this information beginner chances of putting that fish into the net would increase.

#**Server-Side Components**
The app would collect each userâ€™s personal information and there would be a section about what species they would love to target for future suggestions of baits and techniques they can practice.
